# A-Python-Recreation

Objective:
Recreate Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis's discovery of the importance of handwashing in hospitals using Python.

Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis's discovery of the importance of handwashing in hospitals revolutionized healthcare and significantly reduced mortality rates. In this project, we will recreate Dr. Semmelweis's discovery using Python. We will read the historical dataset, explore the relationship between variables over different periods, perform calculations to compare mortality rates before and after handwashing implementation, and visualize the impact of handwashing on reducing mortality rates.
